# OnlineCTR Steam Deck Guide


<b>Disclaimer:</b> This guide is by no means the best or most efficient way to do this, but as it is generally a convoluted process I felt it 
was worth making a quick guide for. I'm sure this process can be improved upon, but as of now I don't have the time or interest
in looking into this further. But perhaps someone else can build upon this!


The following guides are on how to set up Online CTR on the steam deck using the windows version of Duckstation. Note if you prefer
it is possible to do this natively instead, but there will be other steps in making this work which involves compiling the client
and getting a special version of Duckstation. If you are interested in reading more about this you should check the OnlineCTR
discord. As of time of writing they are not supporting Linux however.
